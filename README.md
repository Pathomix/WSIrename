Renaming wsi files is annoying - as you have to open the file to see the label. This allows us to see the label and change the name without waiting for the file to open.

The app allows you to rotate and zoom the slide label using the keyboard.

- `R` - rotate
- `E` - zoom in 
- `W` - zoom out
- `U` - undo


## Usage

Download the MAC version of the app - [here](https://github.com/c-arthurs/WSIname/releases/download/v1.0.0/WSIrename_Mac.app.zip)
