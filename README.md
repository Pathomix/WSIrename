# WSIrename - Free Trial
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/57836474/194433742-ebd8e93e-37c0-41bb-953f-a0b9c8167d0b.png" alt="drawing" width="200" align="right"/>


Renaming wsi files is time consuming - you have to open the file to see the label then close it again to rename the file. This increases the chances that errors will be made. WSIrename allows us to see the label and change the name. Without waiting for the entire WSI file to open, and without having to close it again. This makes the manual process as quick as it can possibly be without a barcoding system in place. 

The app allows you to rotate and zoom the slide label using the keyboard.

- `R` - rotate
- `E` - zoom in 
- `W` - zoom out
